    <meta name="description" content="A photograph: an attempt to frame that which encounters time. Time moves, so does the photograph, a body follows. An underexposed photograph depicts an overexposed body, abstracts it. The body attempts to generate a new alphabet. The body is a language of its own. Let the body do what the photograph does not expect; an ever-changing photo ritual, encoded in the time that runs by. All are documents of that which exists.">
